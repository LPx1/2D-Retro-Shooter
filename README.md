# 2D-Retro-Shooter

The project creates bullets and sprites through use of emitters. The player's ship can fire at enemies using the spacebar and move around using the arrow keys to their respective directions. Collision detection is calculated through checking through the distance and size of the colliding objects and if the object would enter its space and collide in the next frame. 

In order to make the game a little more challenging to achieve a score, I implemented a way to have the direction of the enemy sprites launched changed at different intervals. Also implemented other enemy sprites rather than just having a singular enemy sprite.
